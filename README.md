# E-commerce Shopping Website with FakeStore Api

This is a fully responsive e-commerce shopping website project built using React
and Tailwind CSS. The website utilizes dummy data from the **Fake Store API** to
display products. The user can view the featured products on the home page,
select a product to view its details, and add products to the cart. The cart
page displays the added products, quantities, and total price.
